It is the small traditions that make camp unique. Laurelwood has provided a safe haven for me to pursue my passions with the most supportive staff and campers, and I consider myself incredibly lucky to have not only a summer family, but a forever family, in the 06443.'

Being Junior Girls’ Division Head is an amazing experience unlike anything else, and I feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to connect with so many incredible campers and staff this summer.'

When the 7 weeks are over and I have my first moment to reflect on the summer, I realize that all throughout each of those special days I was actually growing as a person and becoming a more genuine, thoughtful version of myself.'
