      <p>At Laurelwood we believe that our <strong>program structure</strong> is as important as the relationships the campers make.</p>
      <p>To ensure our campers are receiving high quality programming, we have developed <strong>Camp Activity Plans (CAPs)</strong>, which:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide Age-appropriate activities</li>
        <li>Provide campers the opportunity to learn or a grow a new skill</li>
        <li>Ensure the activities are Fun</li>
      </ul>
